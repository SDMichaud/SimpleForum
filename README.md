# Refactoring
This branch will hold the source code for the new application running without the Laravel framework.

# New Setup
The project will now use PHP with the PDO extention and a mySQL database. The new setup seems to be in line with how the old setup used to run with the Laravel framework and is about 1% of the size. Manual setup of a mySQL database and modification of the relevent sections of the source code is required for those looking to get this running locally. More details to follow in later commits.
